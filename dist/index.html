          <p>
            A small machine learning project. Machine learning is a great buzz
            word in these times, but it still does not have the right merit. To
            understand it better, I created a small perceptron that had a line
            with above it 1's and below it 0's. The machine had to learn where
            the line should go.

          <p>
            To create a simple little app or other software quickly, we can use
            an API. As a user of internet I can quickly connect to a vast amount
            of data on a server. I used a twitter api called 'Twit' and a
            Youtube Search Api, and created my own monster that can use both. I
            automated tweeting about videos I posted on my Youtube channel.

          <p>
            Counter Strike is a game I played since I was 12 years old and I
            have fond memories of those days. But I needed to know how got I
            still was. Therefore I created a stats tracker with the use of
            https://tracker.gg/csgo as API. Fill in your Counter Strike: Global
            Offensive ID number and check how much of a n00b you are (compared
            to me).

            More information about this project on the 'Wisekrakr Games' page.
            This one was my first 'real' project to create a tiny game engine
            that could help me make games easier in the future. With the help of
            libraries as LibGDX and Ashley. By doing this, I showed myself that
            I had the skill to create something big out of nothing.

          <h3>Horde!</h3>
          <p>
            As a gamer I played so many FPS games, it's sickening. To understand
            more of what goes behind a game like that, I created a tiny one of
            my own. Coding a game like this is not that difficult. The
            difficulty, for me, lies in the animations and graphical aspects in
            a 3D world. It was a total new experience for me, but not something
            I would revisit soon.

          <p>
            For a game jam called js13kGames I entered this game. Made within
            three weeks in Javascript, from scratch, without any external
            libraries and it had to be 13k zipped. As well as a great learning
            method to teach myself javascript fast, it was also a great social
            experiment for me. To get to know the gaming dev community and how
            most are helpful and honest.

          <h3>Movie Search App</h3>
          <p>
            A small web app where we can search for our favorite movies, with
            the help of axios. Axios makes requests or promises from the browser
            by way of an API. In this case I am using the Omdb API. The api
            makes a request for a movie name for instance, the backend will
            request the Omdb server for that name, and the frontend will show
            the result to the user. This is a simple beginners app to learn the
            difference between frontend and backend and to understand what it
            means to do requests.

            market widget. It is a responsive website, so it also look great on
            mobile apparatuses. It also was deployed on Netlify.

            The World's Interconnective Study Experience is a social network
            site for people who like to learn and also teach others. It is used
            as a hub for everything that you know and would like to know. You
            can create a study item and add documents so that other can learn
            from your studies. People can form a "classroom" and discuss a
            certain topic together, all in the name of knowledge gathering. It
            is build with React, a javascript library for building user
            interfaces. I used MongoDB as a database, Express as a web framework
            and of course Node.js as runtime environment: The MERN Stack.

            My goal was to teach myself to code. I used my philosophy background
            and affinity for logic to help me find the way. After just a couple
            of years I am able to design and develop solutions that represent
            everything my skills need to compete in the modern marketplace.
